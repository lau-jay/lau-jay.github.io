## Chinese character error, all chinese became `[][][]`
Chinese character error after update manjaro. so i search how to fix this issue.
I guess it missing fonts, so search `manjaro chinese fonts missing`.

I find this [topic](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/chinese-character-error-all-chinese-became-in-jwm/5827) from google result.

Have an answer say: `Install these wqy fonts`.

`$sudo pacman -Ss wqy`

I try it, question solve.
